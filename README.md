# Animation-template

An animation template made with L.js.

I made L.js to learn and understand better javascript. L.js is really similar to p5.js, some function are the same, but overall, I made everything with no help :).

### To include just the javascript put this in the head:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Luj8n/Animation-template@main/libraries/L.js/Vector2D.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Luj8n/Animation-template@main/libraries/L.js/general-functions.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Luj8n/Animation-template@main/libraries/L.js/canvas-functions.js"></script>
```
